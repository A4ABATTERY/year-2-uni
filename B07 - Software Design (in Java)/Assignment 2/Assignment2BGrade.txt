Group number: 0413
UTORID usernames of members: biswas19, kamales8, somasu22, tsangw18
Total deductions: 2
Grade: A-

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog.

target
original
group_0413@A2:~/$ cd target
group_0413@A2:~/target$ cat original
