What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked with team to split tasks from the product backlog, for the sprint
    - Discussed and planned out a new design to in corporate the new commands
      with team
    - Worked with team to plan out stderr and stdout classes and subclasses to
      differentiate between different types of input/output
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Work on task C and D (mv and cp commands)
    - Work on their test classes, and would also like to complete those
      from Assignment2A (did not complete all test classes)
    
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Filesystem may be reworked a bit to incorporate an iterator and
      generics. (may interfere)
