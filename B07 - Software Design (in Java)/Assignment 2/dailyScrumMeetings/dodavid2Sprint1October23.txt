What did I work on the last 3 days?
    -Wrote two ways to implement appending more text to File Class
    -Wrote Constructor for File Class
    -Wrote parts of Echo.execute() that didn't require LS
What do I plan to do for the next 3 days?
    -Make Java Documentation for Echo and File
    -Complete execute for Echo class
    -write code for validation method
Am I blocked on anything?
    -Need ls to work before complete Echo class
