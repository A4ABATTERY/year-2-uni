What did I work on in the last three days?
    - We reworked the design again, and it is ready to incorporate the new commands, we decided that each command would
      output a list of stdouts and stderrors, so that testing is easier, and organization is much better
    - Worked on fixing errors in multiple classes due to the previous design change
    - Worked on test classes from Assignment 2A
    
What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - Incorporate the ideas mentioned above and complete testclasses later
    - Start working on cp and mv
    
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to work on a few new design ideas before testing, because there were a few issues
      with our command outputs that made testing somewhat difficult and unclear. Need
      these to be done before i can continue
