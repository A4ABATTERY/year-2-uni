  What did I work on in the last three days?
	- JShell.java
		- Making JShell keep track of rootDirectory, currentDirectory, and the hashmap
			- We decided to make these three static variables
			- This means that there would be a two way collaboration between JShell
			  and every other command.
				-This may be changed later. NOTE : We should probably talk to Abbas idk.
	- fixing compile errors.
		- Helped with syntax checking
		- Helped point out issues with my peers' code.
What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- Finish ListDirectory.
	- Start preparing for Sprint2.
		- I will also be editing Sprint1. I will write up the ways that out group deviated
		  from the original plan in a 'Edits' section made at the end of the documents.
	- Transfer crcCards from GoogleDrive to this repository.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Nothing at the moment.
		- I will update the team on if i am.
