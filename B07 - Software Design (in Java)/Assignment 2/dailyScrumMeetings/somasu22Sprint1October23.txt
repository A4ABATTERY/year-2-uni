What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished Directory and ChangeDirectory with error handling and most documentation
    - Re-organized the filesystem and added a parent FileObject Class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Delegate tasks and finish sprint 2 backlog tomorrow 
    - Complete crcCards and finish up documentation
    - Finish MakeDirectory using pushd and popd commands

Am I blocked on anything?
    - For MakeDirectory I decided to use the pushd and popd commands, which we have not done yet, 
      but will do for the next sprint.(I am moving MakeDirectory to sprint2)
