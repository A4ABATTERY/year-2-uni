What i worked on in the last three days?
    - Testing code and reporting bugs
    - Learning how to make 'test classes'
    - Discussing mkdir and echo functions

What do I plan to work on the next three days?
    - all crcCards are final now.
        - We havn't been transffering them because its easier to view them in a 'mind-map' on google drive

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Still waiting on being taught how to make 'test classes'
        - this is probably going to be covered tomorrow.
