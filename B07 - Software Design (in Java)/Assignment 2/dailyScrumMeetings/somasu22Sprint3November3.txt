What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished our demo with the TA
    - Tested MakeDirectory, ChangeDirectory, Pop/PushDirectory through main method
      of JShell (did not use test classes yet)
    - Found a few errors and update the classes
    - Also thought of a few test cases to put in some test classes for the next
      scrum meeting

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Complete some testclasses for the next scrum meeting
      - fix any issues this testing reveals
    - Need to finish Javadocs and comments
    - review CRC cards to make sure they are coherent with our design

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Would like to make test classes for testing my classes but I do not feel 
      completely confident with them yet, and would like to review lecture slides and
      learn more in the next lecture before I start
