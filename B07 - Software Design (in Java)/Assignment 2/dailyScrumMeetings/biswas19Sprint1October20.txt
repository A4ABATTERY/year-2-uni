What did I work on in the last three days?
  - Productbacklog
  - Sprint 1
  - Making skeleton code for JShell.
  - Collaborated and made cd, mkdir, ls, echo, and man
  - Clearing confusion about what is being asked
      -ie. In inheritance necessary.
      -How will everything communicate 
      -using a hashmap

What do I plan to work on in the the next three days?
  - crcCards. Namely, ListDirectory, Jshell, and HashmapCom
  - More skeleton code. I will be coding up ListDirectory.

Am I blocked on anything?
  - I need a filesystem to work with. I can't start on ListDirectory without it.
      -mkdir needs to be completed.
          -I need to make directories so that i can test ListDirectory.
      -cd needs to be completed.
          - I need to use functionality of cd to test ListDirectory with paths.
      -Potentially pushD and popD as well ().
          - Depends on how i want to implement ListDirectory. This is tentative.
