What did I work on the last 3 days?
    -Talked with Arunav about the implementation of LS
    -Modified existing method getDirinDirectory inside Directory class
    and made it compatible with FileObject instead of only Directory, and
    renamed the method into getObjInDirectory
What do I plan to do for the next 3 days?
    -Use getObjInDirectory to finish Echo method editFile
    -Create the CRC card text file for Echo
    -Create the Exit Class
Am I blocked on anything?
    -Not at the moment.
