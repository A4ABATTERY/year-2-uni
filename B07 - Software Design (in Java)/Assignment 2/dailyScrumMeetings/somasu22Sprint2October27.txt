What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Updated Directory and ChangeDirectory with static methods that other commands can use
    - Added a DirectoryStack class for pushd and popd commands which i can later use
      to finish makeDirectory

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish crc cards for my classes 
    - Finish MakeDirectory using pushd and popd commands

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to finish pushd and popd before i can finish makeDirectory
