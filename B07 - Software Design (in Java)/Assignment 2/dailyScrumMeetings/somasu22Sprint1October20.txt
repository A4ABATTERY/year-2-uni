What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked on Directory and ChangeDirectory
    - Brainstormed new design ideas with group to accomodate professor's advice 
    - Worked on Product/Sprint Backlog with group and delegated tasks
    - Worked together on crcCards

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finalize Directory and ChangeDirectory (with error handling and commenting)
    - Complete crcCards with the group
    - Complete MakeDirectory after discussing design ideas with group

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need the filesystem design to be rediscussed in order for me to complete the Directory/ChangeDirectory Classes and to start on MakeDirectory
