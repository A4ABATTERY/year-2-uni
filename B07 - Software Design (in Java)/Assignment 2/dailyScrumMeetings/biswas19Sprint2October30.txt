What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Sprint 2
		- I wrote up the document and gave everyone tasks.
	- ShellHistory.java
	- Helped with Directory.java
		-Cleared up confusion and decided to use Directory.java as the 'FileSystem'
	
What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
	- ShellHistory.java
	- Sprint3
		- And giving out tasks.
	- Edit Sprint2
		- Logging deviation from the original plan (tasks defined in Sprint 2)
	- Will be ironing out Bugs
		- I am going to try and make a test suite. Need to review and may need help.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not really.
