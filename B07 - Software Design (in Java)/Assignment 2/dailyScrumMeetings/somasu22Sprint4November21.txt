What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished fixing all the errors/bugs introduced from the new design
    - reworked Directory and FileObject for mv and cp commands
    - Started on mv and cp commands
    - we decided to move test classes for later, because it seems a little more
      complicated then we initially thought
    
What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - finish cp and mv
    - finish all the testclasses after getting advice from the prof
    
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Could not complete testclasses because i am not entirely sure if I should be using
      a mockfilesystem to easily set up each of the testclasses. But im not sure how that
      would work.
