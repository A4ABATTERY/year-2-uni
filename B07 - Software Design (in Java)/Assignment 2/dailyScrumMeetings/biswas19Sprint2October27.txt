what did I work on in the last 3 days?

	- Fixing bugs in ListDirectory
	- Had to cahnge ListDirectory to work with new changes in CHangeDirectory
	- Needed to make more edits to crcCards in the google driver folder\

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?

	- Continue workin on crcCards;
	-Discuss how the implementation fo History is supposede to work.


Am I blocked on anything?

	- Not really, but there are a couple of bugs in ChangeDirectory.getDirInPath();
		- These bugs effect how ListDirectory functions.
