Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog. 

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6] [0 marks deducted]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  No evidence of Product or Sprint backlog -6
- [ ]  No evidence of team assigning tasks to team members -3
- [ ]  SB items not taken directly from PB -1
- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1
- [ ]  PB, SB uses noticeably bad grammar and/or spelling -2

==== Java Style ==== [up to -6] [1 marks deducted]

Steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  Java naming conventions not followed (camelCase, no_underscores) -1
- [ ]  Instance variable names not meaningful (e.g., "Label1" is not a good name) -1
- [ ]  Bad indentation -1
- [ ]  Lack of consistency in style across files -1
- [ ]  Bad use of whitespace: too much or too little -1
- [ ]  Class names are frequently not noun phrases -1
- [ ]  Method names are frequently not verb phrases -1

TA COMMENTS:

		- HashMapCom.java:22
		- Echo.java:85
		- MakeDirectory.java:47

==== Design ==== [up to -6] [3 marks deducted]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  public instance variables instead of setters and getters -1 to -2
- [x]  not a good breakdown of classes and methods (everything static;) -1
- [ ]  long methods exist (more than roughly 30 lines from brace to brace) -1
- [ ]  hard to add new commands -1
- [ ]  no unified path handling mechanism -2
- [x]  redirection doesn't easily incorporate new commands -2

TA COMMENTS:
		* The handling of redirection is deeply incorporated in echo, which makes it difficult to add 
		redirection for new commands.
		* Many static methods are found all over the code.

==== Javadoc ==== [up to -3] [0 marks deducted]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  Missing Javadoc on methods -1 for infrequent problems, up to -3 for frequent
- [ ]  Missing Javadoc on class -1

TA COMMENTS:
* Code crashes with following commands
	>man nonExistanceCommand
	example:
	>man apt
	*It should print appopriate message, never crash.
	
1.	Echo without strings should print appropriate error message
	>echo hello 
	Actual Output:
	hello
	
2. history with bad argument
		> history -100
	Should print appropriate error message
